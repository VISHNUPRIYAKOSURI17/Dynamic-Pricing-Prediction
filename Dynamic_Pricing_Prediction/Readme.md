# 📈 Dynamic Pricing Prediction

## 🔍 Introduction

**Dynamic Pricing Prediction** is an intelligent system that adapts product prices based on consumer behavior and preferences. Rather than applying static price tags, this project introduces a dynamic pricing model that classifies customers based on their product selections and offers customized prices accordingly. 

Dynamic pricing is widely used across various industries including retail, automotive, travel, telecommunications, and energy. The system aims to optimize revenue by leveraging customer data, historical behavior, and demand trends while ensuring fairness, segmentation, and reduced arbitrage opportunities.

By analyzing past interactions, consumer preferences, and market demand, this project helps businesses align pricing strategies with customer segments — delivering both personalized value and profit optimization.
